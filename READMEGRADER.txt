Our second use case submisison is "access previous orders." Although it
was orginally designed to be a separate page and interface, our walkthrough
feedback suggested a new approach where the use case is encapsulated into our
previous use case: "Create Issue Ticket." Specifically, previous orders the customer
made are accessed by the dropdown under the "Create Issue Ticket" screen. This allows
the user to associate their complaint with a specific order, which was another piece
of feedback in our walkthrough.

Here is the screen flow to see our use case(s) in action.

1. Login (make sure "customer" is selected and one of the two credential
    options are entered)
       USERNAME    PASSWORD
       =====================
    a. "username", "password"
    b. "mzk123",   "1234"

2. Customer Menu Screen
3. Create Issue Ticket


Beyond this, we also added a new interface, as can be selected in the Customer 
Menu screen: "View Previous Tickets." This allows a customser to see a summary 
of each issue ticket they had previously submitted. This in itself is arguably 
its own use case, although it was not orginally a use case we had designed; but, 
we found it was necessary to compliment the "create issue ticket" use case.
