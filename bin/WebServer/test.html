				<p>
				One of my philosophies is to not have hopes or dreams, but goals and aspirations. The major difference is that a goal or aspiration sounds more definitive and possible than a fleeting hope or dream. There is a sense of impact in those words where I am not looking for something positive to happen to me because I would like it to be so. But that I am using any abilities and resources at my disposal to ensure that I fulfill those goals. If I don’t know enough, I will learn till that requirement is reached, if I don’t have enough experience I will attain it, if I am missing the skill sets required I will take whatever free-time in my day to gain the skills. Achieving your goal is a process and here are some of mine.
